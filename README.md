## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Scripts

1. **Load the data**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_loading.py
    ```
    This script loads and displays the initial data.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/eda.py
    ```
    This script performs EDA and visualizes the data. 

3. **Conduct Advanced Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/advanced_analysis.py
    ```
    This script performs correlation and regression analysis.

4. **Predict Future Oak Acreage**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/predict_oak_acreage.py
    ```
    This script uses historical oak acreage data to predict future trends.

5. **Predict Future Precipitation and Temperature**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/predict_precip_temp.py
    ```
    This script uses historical precipitation and temperature data to predict future trends.

6. **Analyze Remote Sensing Data**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/remote_sensing_analysis.py
    ```
    This script processes and compares satellite images from 2005 and 2010 to identify changes in vegetation.

## Scripts Explanation

### `data_loading.py`
This script loads the data from the `data/` directory and displays the first few rows of each dataset to ensure proper loading.

### `eda.py`
This script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the data using various plots and graphs.

### `advanced_analysis.py`
This script performs correlation and regression analysis on the combined dataset. It generates a correlation heatmap and regression plots to analyze the relationships between different variables. 

### `predict_oak_acreage.py`
This script predicts future oak acreage using historical data. It applies an exponential smoothing model to forecast future trends. 

### `predict_precip_temp.py`
This script predicts future precipitation and temperature using historical data. It applies an exponential smoothing model to forecast future trends. 

### `remote_sensing_analysis.py`
This script processes and compares satellite images from 2005 and 2010 to identify changes in vegetation.

## Outputs

The outputs generated by the scripts are saved in the `outputs/` directory. These include:
- **EDA Plots**: Visualizations from the EDA script.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Heatmap showing correlations between different variables.
- **Regression Plots**: Plots showing regression analysis results.
- **Forecast Plots**: Plots showing forecasted trends for oak acreage, precipitation, and temperature.
- **Remote Sensing Plots**: Comparisons of vegetation between 2005 and 2010.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- rasterio

Install these packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
